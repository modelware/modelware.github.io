#### Description

This project intends to develop an OWL-to-OML interface to complement the existing OML-to-OWL interface in the [OWL Adapter](https://github.com/opencaesar/owl-adapter). The adapter will support two levels of conversion. The first level assumes that the OWL conforms to the OML profile (a subset of OWL). The second level does NOT assume the OWL conforms to the OML profile, so the result might be partial (best effort). This level will be used to convert public domain OWL ontologies to OML.

#### Team

- [Maged Elaasar](/maged-elaasar.html), Ph.D., Modelware (PI)

#### Results

We released v2.6.0 of the OWL adapter which contains an implementation of the first level of the OWL-to-OML interface.

The second level is still in alpha. Initial results on converting some public domain ontologies are promising but need to be assessed further. If you have suggestions of OWL ontologies that you like to be included in the testing, please contact us.
