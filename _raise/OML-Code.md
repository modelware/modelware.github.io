#### Description

This project intends to develop a VS Code extension called <b>OML Code</b> that implements a language server for the [OML](https://www.opencaesar.io/oml/) (Ontological Modeling Language) in Typescript using the [Langium](https://langium.org/) framework and the [Sprotty](https://sprotty.org/) library. The language server will support a text editor for OML in addition to graphical viewer and editor. When ready, the extension is expected to replace the current [OML Luxor](https://github.com/opencaesar/oml-luxor) extension.
