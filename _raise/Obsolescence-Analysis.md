#### Description

This project focuses on the study of the potential impact of obsolescence scenarios throughout a complex system from the early stages of design. 
The analysis utilizes the concepts in the Ontological Modeling Language (OML) such as requirements, functions, and components; and the relations between them. It also expands the ontology to address functional redundancies. 
An adaptation of the Martian Rover presented in: "Castet, Jean-Francois & Bareh, Magdy & Nunes, Jeffery & Jenkins, Steven & Lee, Gene. (2016). Fault Management Ontology and Modeling Patterns. 10.2514/6.2016-5544." is modeled in OML. 
This model is used to illustrate the application of the proposed model-based obsolescence analysis framework, that was implemented with a Jupyter Notebook.
