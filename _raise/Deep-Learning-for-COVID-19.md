#### Description

This project focuses on harnessing the power of deep learning, natural language processing (NLP), and big data analytics to analyze large-scale unstructured media content (text, audio, and video) related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Given the global deluge of pandemic-related information, the team developed an automated framework capable of transforming news media into concise, trustworthy, and categorized insights. The system includes components for automatic speech recognition, text summarization (both extractive and abstractive), topic classification, trend analysis, and multimedia visualization. This work aims to empower decision-makers and public health agencies by providing real-time insights into how COVID-19 was perceived, reported, and acted upon across different regions.

This collaborative project with UAE University while trying to address the COVID-19 infodemic, it also lays the foundation for AI-driven monitoring solutions that integrate structured and unstructured data sources.
