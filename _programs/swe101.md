		<p><b>Description</b>: This program offers early-career software engineers (or students) a structured and rigorous internship experience. Participants will engage with all activities involved in the software development lifecycle, adhering to industry best practices. These activities encompass selecting development methodologies, capturing and analyzing requirements, defining architecture, designing, coding, writing test suites and measuring their effectiveness, conducting thorough code reviews, detecting anti-patterns, refactoring code, setting up continuous integration pipelines, automating deployment, and leveraging cloud services. Through team collaboration in a start-up  environment, participants will gain hands-on experience by developing a software system they propose themselves or one provided by an industry partner. Multiple deliverables will be expected, and mentorship will be provided throughout the project. Participants will receive individual feedback on their understanding of best practices through graded quizzes and exams, as well as on the quality of their application of these practices in the project. Note: this program does not teach programming/coding; it assumes you already have a basic knowledge of object-oriented programming with Java to follow the coding examples.It also does not prescribe using any programming languages, technology stacks or frameworks for the project; you are expected to choose those.</p>

		<p><b>Read what some of our former participants have said:</b></p>
		<blockquote>
  		<p><b>Rajavi Shah</b> has said: "I took this course with Professor Elaasar in Spring 2024 at Northeastern University, and it’s been invaluable during my co-op at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. The course provided a holistic, startup-like experience where I learned to handle every aspect of a project in an industry-standard way—from planning and project management to testing and deployment. Skills like using GitHub Projects, testing frameworks, and creating deployment pipelines directly helped in my interviews and in launching projects from scratch. I’d highly recommend this course to anyone looking to bridge academics and the professional world!"</p>
		</blockquote>
		<blockquote>
  		<p><b>Jonathan Mitchell</b> has said: "I just started an internship at Nvidia with the Autonomous driving team and I would like to thank Dr Elaasar for teaching me about design patterns and infrastructure at UCLA; it’s really paying off and is extremely valuable. I am literally drawing UML diagrams right now. My team loves that I know this stuff already."</p>
