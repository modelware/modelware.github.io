## About Me

David Wagner manages the Flight Systems Architectures and Behaviors group at [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/)â€™s Jet Propulsion Laboratory ([JPL](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/)) at the California Institute of Technology ([Caltech](https://www.caltech.edu/)). He is also the technical manager for the CAESAR development project that is central to JPL's Integrated Model-Centric Engineering program. The CAESAR project specifically aims to develop model-centric methodology and tooling to transform the system engineering of JPL missions into a rigorous, agile, and information-centric practice. Prior to working on CAESAR, he served as a model architect and project system engineer on the Europa Clipper project. And prior to that he has extensive experience architecting and developing flight- and ground-based software systems supporting robotic space missions at JPL.
