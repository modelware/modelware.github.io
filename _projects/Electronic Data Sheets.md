#### Description

This project intends to implement an openCAESAR tool for the CCSDS standard on Electronic Data Sheet (EDS). This includes developing OML-based vocabulary for EDS, developing an example system, developing an authoring tool within one of the OML-based IDEs, developing backand-forth translators to the standard XML schema, and developing analysis and reporting viewpoints.
