#### Description

This course offers a comprehensive introduction to modern Systems Engineering and its application in addressing complex engineering challenges. It emphasizes making Systems Engineering more rigorous, agile, and automated through the use of advanced technologies, particularly formal methods, agile practices, and AI techniques. Students will explore fundamental aspects of the discipline, including concept development, requirements engineering, architectural specification, integration and testing, verification and validation, and operational support. The course also introduces cutting-edge tools and methodologies such as ontological modeling, consistency checking, temporal analysis, constraint solving, fuzzing, reactive monitoring, testing, and the use of AI assistants. In addition to these foundations, students will engage in a team-based R&D project to complement their learning. By the end of the course, students will have developed a solid understanding of Systems Engineering and the role of technology in enhancing its practiceâ€”preparing them to contribute effectively to the development of complex systems across a variety of industries.
