#### Description

This course offers a comprehensive introduction to modern Systems Engineering and its application in addressing complex engineering challenges. It emphasizes Systems Engineering as a rigorous, agile, and automated discipline through the use of advanced technologies, particularly formal methods, agile practices, and AI techniques. Students will explore key aspects of the discipline, including methodology development, concept specification, requirements engineering, architectural modeling, risk management and trade studies, integration, verification and validation, configuration and change management, collaboration, and operations. The course also introduces various technologies such as ontological modeling, consistency checking, constraint solving, fuzz testing, reactive monitoring, and the use of AI assistants. In addition, students will learn about known methodologies, hear about case studies and engage in a team-based R&D project to complement their learning. By the end of the course, students will have developed a solid understanding of Systems Engineering and the role of technology in enhancing its practiceâ€”preparing them to contribute effectively to the development of complex systems across a variety of industries.
