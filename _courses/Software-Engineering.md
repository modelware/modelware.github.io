#### Description

This course provides both theory and hands-on experience with the development of large-scale software systems. You will learn systematic methods for large-scale software development including: agile process, software analysis, architecture patterns, design patterns, code generation, unit testing, regression testing, bug finding, code refactoring, and DevOps. You will get to practice these methods in the context of a software project developed in collaboration with other participants. This course will not teach coding; you are expected to already have basic knowledge of object-oriented programming in Java, which will be used for basic coding exercises and to demonstrate coding examples.
