I recently thought of trying to use ChatGPT 3.5 to lower the bar of querying an ontological dataset with natural language (e.g., English). Basically, what I was trying is to see how good ChatGPT can write an equivalent SPARQL query to a question I may pose in natural language.

Look for the details coming soon!
