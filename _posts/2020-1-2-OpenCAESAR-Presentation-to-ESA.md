On May 21, 2019, Maged Elaasar, from JPL, has presented on OpenCAESAR to members of the MB4SE Advisory Group at ESA. The group is interested in exploring rigorous approaches to MBSE including ones based on semantic web technologies. 

A follow up presentation to the same group took place on June 26, 2019 by Hans Peter, from ESA, where he reflected on the OpenCAESAR technology. Here is a [link](https://indico.esa.int/event/310/contributions/4581/attachments/3514/4653/Presentation_-_1430_-_Hans-Peter_de_Koning.pdf) to that presentation.
